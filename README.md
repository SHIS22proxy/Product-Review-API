5. Best Practices
Restrict to Verified Purchases: Allow only users who bought the product to review

Prevent Spam: Use rate-limiting and moderation filters

Profanity Filters: Scan and flag inappropriate content

Pagination & Caching: Optimize review list queries

Highlight Verified Reviews: Increase trust and visibility

Allow Review Editing: Let users update their feedback

Notify Sellers: Alert when new reviews are posted

6. Common Issues & Troubleshooting
Issue	Cause	Solution
Duplicate review	User submits multiple reviews for the same product	Enforce one review per product per user
Profanity/inappropriate content	Unfiltered user input	Use moderation engine or third-party services
Performance lag	Uncached aggregate queries	Use Redis or query optimization
Unverified user	Not logged in	Require JWT or session token
Missing product ID	Invalid or null request	Validate input before DB call
